TODOs:
- Which features affect classification (i.e. 0 vs non 0 loss)
- split classification (0 vs non 0s) and regression?


- feature extraction??
- impute the important features better



Finished TODOs:
- impute using both training and testing data. but the same values for training and testing => no improvement :(
- try imputing using median instead of mean => no improvement :(
- better feature selection (kinda. not really :( )
- try random combinations of features. see if the corration with y improves => tried sum and product. didn't work :(
- transform y values into their corresponding cdfs? => doesn't make a difference :(
