TODOs:
- transform y values into their corresponding quantiles?
- feature extraction??
- impute the important features better

Finished TODOs:
- impute using both training and testing data. but the same values for training and testing => no improvement :(
- try imputing using median instead of mean => no improvement :(
- better feature selection (kinda. not really :( )
