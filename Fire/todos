TODOs:

- v11 is def a leak

- vulnerability study -- different categories have different sensitivity of other variables (e.g. Ridge with diff coefficients)
- try fitting non-linear stuff (e.g. quadratic, beta)
- feature extraction??
- impute the important features better



Finished TODOs:
- impute using both training and testing data. but the same values for training and testing => no improvement :(
- try imputing using median instead of mean => no improvement :(
- better feature selection (kinda. not really :( )
- try random combinations of features. see if the corration with y improves => tried sum and product. didn't work :(
- transform y values into their corresponding cdfs? => doesn't make a difference :(
- Which features affect classification (i.e. 0 vs non 0 loss)
- split classification (0 vs non 0s) and regression? => didn't work!!!! :''''(
