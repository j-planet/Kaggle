TODOs:

- look at correlation matrix. rf may be messed up now
- encode state and location

Finished todos:
- encode car value
- pandas pivot table avergae function needs to ignore nans

bug fixes:
- the leading factors are strange now
    <= pandas merge messes up the order
- pandas pivot table ignore "object" fields. i.e. even if we map from string to int (e.g. car_value), it will still be ignored due to the dtype still being object.
    <= created a new field.  pandas u r a piece of shit
